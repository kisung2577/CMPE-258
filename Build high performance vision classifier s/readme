Build high performance vision classifier s 
 

Use TPU in colab please. 

 

a) Demonstrate how convolution layers themselves work visually in colab

b) implement depth wise pooling layer in keras and demonstrate its use

c) 

Part 2:

Three colabs with  vision classifiers - data  - mnist, fashion mnist and cifar 10

 

demonstrate for each colab :

a) use simple neural network as well as lenet-5  - two architectures

 

b) demonstrate pretrained model with transfer learning  (both efficient net and BiT)

c) Demonstrate imge augmentation 

d) demonstrate with state of art image models - mlp-mixer

 

Part 3:

 

a) Xray pnemonea classification with convnet

b) 3d image classication of ctscan
